## Overview

## Backlog
* Things to try
    1. test with number of channels equal to the number of layers
    2. try it with the anime face dataset (https://github.com/jayleicn/animeGAN)
    3. try the tips from (https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks)
        * batch norm, leaky relu.
    4. post question to Machine Learning Subreddit or other site?
* Clean this repo.
* fix the images saved to tensorboard. They probably just need to be scaled.



## Notes
* Time for 100 batches of size 16 for anime: 8:22
    * about 500 seconds per 100
    * 20 Days for 100 Epochs
